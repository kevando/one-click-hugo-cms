Zharki continues to ween itself off Mylta Power, revealing new opportunities. Newly installed wind turbines can provide 90% of the city's power.

The people of Zharki prefer this cleaner source of energy, but do not expect Mylta Power Co. to back down without a fight. The Mytla power plant and nearby factory contain far more loot than Zharki, so expect to see a long lasting battle here over new vs old energy.
