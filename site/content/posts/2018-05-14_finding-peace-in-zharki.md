## We wake up every day and face the same questions.



* What to eat for breakfast?
* What’s the weather like?
* Am I really good enough?
* Do we drop hot or take it slow?

Regarding the last question, most people drop hot.

As you can see from this [photo posted to Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/PUBATTLEGROUNDS/comments/69janc/heatmap_of_deaths_in_game_squad_gamemode/), Zharki isn't red.

If you’re getting sick of the chaos of Pochinki, or the rat race of Yasanya Polayna - consider Zharki. Where the city lacks in loot it more than makes up for it in tranquility.
