The origins of Zharki remain somewhat murky, but the founding fathers of the city claimed it exists as a haven from chaos. Most of the energy comes from wind turbines located on the south side of town. 

If you hear someone refer to Zharki as "Zarkarooni" or "The Zhark" that's probably a person from nearby Serveny. People from Georgepool tend to ignore Zharki and forget it even exists.

The population fluctuates between zero and about ten. It can get up to fifteen sometimes, but those are very rare days.
