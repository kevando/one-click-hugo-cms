## PUBG Mobile

This is the most recent release, and you can download the app for free for both Android and iPhone. 

[Download PUBG MOBILE from Google Play](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.tencent.ig&hl=en_US)

[Download PUBG MOBILE from iTunes](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/pubg-mobile/id1330123889?mt=8)



## PUBG xBox

Available for $30 you can download it or go to a local store and purchase it. I recommend just downloading it because the store doesn't give you a disc. It's just a code to install.

## PUBG PC

This is the version all the pros play. Just like xBox, this costs $30 and is available through Steam. You need a good PC to run the game well.
