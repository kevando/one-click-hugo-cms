I bought a used xBox One from Gamestop in order to play PlayerUnknown’s Battlegrounds (PUBG). The game provides hours of fun, but it can run slow. The game is currently in preview mode, which means they’re still working out some kinks. 

One of the funnest parts of the game is dropping in areas that lots of other people drop, such as Pochinki, School, or Military Base. Unfortunately, on the older xBox devices like mine, things take time to render. More specifically, they take about 10-30 seconds longer than users with a new xBox. And that means almost certain death in Pochinki.

I bought an external Solid State Drive (SSD) from Samsung and it decreased the render time to the point I don't ever see play dough buildings anymore. Getting it set up is easy.

## 1. [Buy this SSD](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B073GZBT36/ref=oh_aui_detailpage_o07_s00?ie=UTF8&psc=1) 

You do not need to buy _this_ drive, but this is the drive I bought and it works great. 500GB is probably overkill.

## 2. Plug drive into xBox

Your xBox will automatically detect there's a new hard drive and prompt you what to do. Select "format for xBox" and give it a name. This will take a few minutes.

## 3. Install PUBG on external.

Now go to your PUBG app on your xbox and click "Manage Game." You'll now see an option to install on the new drive that you named. 



Welcome to the new world of dropping Pochinki and not dieing every time.
