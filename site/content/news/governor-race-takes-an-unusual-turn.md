It's rare that a candidate for public office would be happy to come in second. But that is the case in the governor's race.

There has been no question about the front-runner, former Pochinki councilman, has led in every poll. But that doesn't just affect his squad. The top two finishers, regardless of party, go head-to-head in November.

No one knows what the impact on squad turnout will be if there are only Democrats to choose from in the governor's race. But Republicans are hoping they won't have a chance to find out.
