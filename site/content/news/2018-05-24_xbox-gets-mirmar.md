Bluehole released patch #12 and it's one of the biggest yet. [Read full patch notes here.](https://forums.playbattlegrounds.com/topic/242318-xbox-game-preview-may-update/)

## Optimized rendering
Lots of new stuff, but one cool change is that buildings can be seen while very
high in the air.

## Emotes
Players can now have some fun with emotes during game play.
