[According to the Korea Times](https://www.koreatimes.co.kr/www/tech/2018/05/134_249598.html),  PUBG Corp filed the suite in January 2018.



Fortnite is an online shooter, launched with a "Save the World" mode that very few people took interest in. It wasn't until Fortnite ripped off PUBG and released their free-to-play Battle Royale mode that anyone cared about Fortnite. 

Does this merit infringement? Well, that's for the courts to decide.
